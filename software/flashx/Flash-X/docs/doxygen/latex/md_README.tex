{\bfseries{NOTE\+:}} If you do not run this from the top-\/level Flash-\/X directory, Doxygen will not be able to properly find the source code files. This is an intentional choice to avoid the use of relative paths that include {\ttfamily ../..}, which will break {\ttfamily @ref}s and and {\ttfamily @link}s to files that are not generated by Doxygen (e.\+g. a {\ttfamily README.\+md} file)
