# Generating and Viewing Doxygen Documentation

From the Flash-X directory:

```bash
# Generate HTML output (default)
doxygen docs/doxygen/Doxyfile

# On OSX, to view the output
open docs/doxygen/html/index.html

# Or on Linx
xdg-open docs/doxygen/html/index.html
``` 

__NOTE:__ If you do not run this from the top-level Flash-X directory, Doxygen will not be able to properly find the source
code files.  This is an intentional choice to avoid the use of relative paths that include `../..`, which will break `@ref`s and and `@link`s to files that are not generated by Doxygen (e.g. a `README.md` file)
