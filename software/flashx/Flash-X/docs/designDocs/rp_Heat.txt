        relative tolerance for temperature errors introduced by HeatExchange.
        This runtime parameter affects the time step computed by
        Heatexchange_computeDt. Basically, if the max (abs) temperature
        adjustment that would be introduced in any nonzero component in any cell
        is less than hx_relTol, then the time step limit is relaxed. Set to a
        negative value to inherite the value of runtime parameter eos_tolerance.
