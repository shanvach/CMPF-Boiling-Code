Clarification of Terms
======================

Note: for simplicity, assume 3D - 2D and 1D are analogous.

 FCRR - flux-correction-related routine

Flux locations
--------------
A flux location identifies a cell face of a cell in a discretized Grid.
A flux location can be labeled by, for example,
 * an index triple together with an integer refinement level
   (using half-integer index for the direction normal to the face);
 * a triple of real coordinates of the face center position (refinement level
   and size of the face being implied by positions);
 * a combination of an integer triple for the position, a refinement
 level, and a direction integer.

Flux values
-----------
A Flux value is a real numerical value that is associated with a flux
location.

Multiflux values
----------------
An ordered tuple of flux values (usually corresponding to fluxes associated
with a set of solution variables).

Fluxes
------
For purposes of describing the interfaces of certain related routines, 
"fluxes" are a collection of (flux location, multiflux value) pairs.

In code, fluxes can be represented by

(for the locations)
 * an AMR block;
 * an AMR level;
 * all cell faces everywhere;
 * for either one or several directions.
(for the values)
 * The multiflux values for one direction of the cell faces of a block, as a
   multidimensional Fortran arrays.
 * The multiflux values for one direction of all cell faces at a refimenment level, as a
   collection of multidimensional Fortran arrays, one per block.
 * The multiflux values for one direction of cells faces at all
   refimenment levels, whether thoses cells are covered by finer cells
   or not.
 * The multiflux values for one direction of all uncovered (i.e.,
   finest) cell faces at all refimenment levels.
 * Same as above, but in a collection iterating over directions.

Flux arguments
--------------

A flux argument identifies "fluxes" in the argument list of a FCRR.
A flux argument can be realized as (examples)
 * a Fortran array giving multiflux values;
 * several arrays giving several sets (blocks, and/or levels) of
   multiflux values;
 * additional arguments identifying the corresponding flux locations.
 * A Flux argument can be implied (not explicitly given) to refer to a
   (sub)set of flux data held in global Grid-owned data arrays
   specifically defined for this purpose.

Semipermanent flux storage
--------------------------

SPFS provides storage for flux data.
SPFS may be realized only for a (possibly small) subset of flux
locations.
SPFS is provided and owned by the Grid unit.
Access to SPFS is provided (primarily) by FCCRs that take flux
arguments.
(Additionally, some programming modes may provide access routines that
act directly on cell-centered solution storage).
Both write access (data flow from fluxes to SPFS) and read access (data
flow from SPFS to fluxes) is possible.

In addition to the access routines, action routines may be provided.
These can modify the abstract state of the SPFS and/or involve
communication.
