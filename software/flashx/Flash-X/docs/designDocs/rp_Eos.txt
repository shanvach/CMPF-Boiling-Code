    eintSwitch [REAL] [0.0]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        a rarely used switch which ensures that internal energy calculations
        maintain sufficient precision. Important only if energyTotal is
        dominated by energyKinetic. If (energyInternal <
        eintSwitch*energyKinetic) then some routines (Eos/Helmholtz,
        Hydro/hy_updateSoln) will NOT calculate energyInternal by subtraction,
        but rather through direct calculation.
    eos_entrEleScaleChoice [INTEGER] [6]
        Valid Values: 1 to 8
        selects a scale variant for representing electron entropy. See code in
        eos_idealGamma for the meaning of the various choices. The choice that
        corresponds most closely to the Sackur-Tetrode equation in physical
        units should be 3, closely followed by 2.
    eos_logLevel [INTEGER] [700]
        Valid Values: 0 to INFTY
        Control verbosity of messages from the Eos unit. See Eos.h for relevant
        EOS_LOGLEVEL_* definitions.

    eos_fluffDens [REAL] [0.0]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        material below this density has its energy replaced if its temperature
        falls below smallt. This should be a small density for enery
        conservation reasons. Only used in the Helmholtz/ExternalAbarZbar
        implementation of Eos.
    eos_forceConstantInput [BOOLEAN] [false]

        preserve equilibrium.  This switch forces a constant input of EINT or
        PRES

        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        default upper bracket bound and used to fake temperature if it tries to
        go too high. Currently, only used in the Helmholtz/ExternalAbarZbar
        implementation of Eos.
