## Containerization

Python scripts located here follow the `source/Simulation/SimulationMain` directory structure and run **Flash-X** simulations inside a container using [Maple](https://github.com/akashdhruv/Maple). These scripts are not part of the default **Flash-X** testing framework but exists as a part of ongoing projects to research containerization with HPC applications.
