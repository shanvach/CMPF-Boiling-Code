!! NAME
!!  Grid_moveParticles
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  Grid_moveParticles(real(INOUT)    :: dataBuf(:,:),
!!                     integer(IN)    :: propCount 
!!                     integer(INOUT) :: localCount,
!!                     integer(IN)    :: maxCount,
!!                     integer(IN)    :: index_list(indexCount),
!!                     integer(IN)    :: indexCount
!!                     logical(IN)    :: coords_in_blk)

!! DESCRIPTION 
!!  
!!  If some of the particles (active or tracer) need to move to the part of the physical
!!  domain that is mapped to a different processor, this function moves their 
!!  data structure to the appropriate processors
!!
!!  This implementations gets particles to the correct processor by first sweeping in the
!!  x direction and moving particles to the x direction neighbors.  Then another sweep 
!!  in the y direction moves particles to the y neighbors, followed by z.  A particle 
!!  then could physically be moved 3 times.  We proceeded in this way because this method
!!  reduces the number of exchanges which are expensive because of latency.
!!  
!! ARGUMENTS 
!!
!!  dataBuf : the data structure containing the data of interest
!!              It is two dimensional real array, the first dimension
!!              represents properties associated with the data 
!!              structure, and 
!!              second dimension is index to individual elements in 
!!              the datastructure.
!!
!! propCount : number of properties for this datastructure 
!!
!!  localCount : While coming in it contains the current 
!!               number of elements in the data structure mapped to
!!               this processor. After all the data structure 
!!               movement, the number might change, 
!!               and the new value is put back into it
!!  maxCount : This is parameter determined at runtime, 
!!             and is the maximum count of elements 
!!             that a simulation expects to have. 
!!             All the arrays  are allocated based on this number
!!
!!  index_list : The list of fields in the incoming dataBuf,
!!               the list are used to make the indices of tag, block
!!               processor and physical location of each individual
!!               data item to the GridParticles subunit so it can
!!               move the concerned data item appropriately
!!  indexCount : The count of fields included in index_list
!!
!!  coords_in_blk   : if true then re-gridding just happened and blocks have changed
!!
