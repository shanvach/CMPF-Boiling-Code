!! NAME
!!
!!  gr_mpoleMom3Dcartesian
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  gr_mpoleMom3Dcartesian (integer, intent(in) :: idensvar)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Compute the multipole moments of the density distribution in
!!  three-dimensional cartesian geometry, assuming the center of mass
!!  and the total mass have first been computed.  On output, the
!!  Moment_R () and Moment_I () arrays contain the mass moments
!!  over the regular and irregular solid harmonics.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  idensvar -- the index of the density variable
!!
