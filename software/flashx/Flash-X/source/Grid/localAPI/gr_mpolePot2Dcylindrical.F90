!! NAME
!!
!!  gr_mpolePot2Dcylindrical
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  gr_mpolePot2Dcylindrical  (integer, intent(in) :: ipotvar)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Computes the potential field for a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry
!!  using the mass moments already calculated. On output the variable
!!  indexed by ipotvar contains the potential. The calculations are
!!  entirely local to each processor, since each processor has a local
!!  copy of the moments.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  ipotvar : index to variable containing the potential
!!
