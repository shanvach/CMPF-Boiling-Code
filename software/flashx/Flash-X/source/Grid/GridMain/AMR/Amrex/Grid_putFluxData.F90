!! NAME
!!  Grid_putFluxData
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!  call Grid_putFluxData(integer(IN)         :: level,
!!                        integer(IN)         :: axis,
!!              optional, integer(IN), target :: pressureSlots(:),
!!              optional, real(IN),           :: areaLeft(:,:,:))
!!
!! DESCRIPTION 
!!  Request that the Grid unit load into its flux registers the flux data
!!  corresponding to the given axial directions and defined on the given
!!  refinement level.  This routine needs to be used with AMR
!!  since fluxes calculated by two blocks at a fine/coarse boundary have 
!!  different accuracy.
!!
!!  It is assumed that before calling this routine, the client code has already
!!  written flux data to Grid's data structures using the Grid_getFluxPtr
!!  interface.  For more information on how to use this flux data to perform
!!  flux correction, refer to the Grid_conserveFluxes documentation.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!  level - the 1-based level index (1 is the coarsest level) indicating which
!!          refinement level's fluxes should be loaded in the flux registers.
!!  axis - integer value specifying on which cell faces to put fluxes. 
!!         The options are IAXIS, JAXIS, or KAXIS defined in constants.h
!!  pressureSlots - If present and greater than zero, this indicates one or more flux
!!                  variables in the fluxes array that may need special handling because
!!                  they really scale like flux densities when other flux variables scale
!!                  like fluxes.  For the split PPM Hydro implementation, for example,
!!                  this is normally used for the pressure "flux" variable, but
!!                  it can be applied to other flux variables that the caller keeps in
!!                  flux density form.
!!                  The special handling consists in multiplying the flux variables with
!!                  the appropriate face areas, which are taken from the areaLeft array
!!                  argument, before storing them in the arrays on which the Grid unit
!!                  acts.
!!                  Special handling should only be requested if the Grid units handles
!!                  flux variable "as fluxes" (or else if it does nto matter anyway,
!!                  as is the case in 1D).
!!                  The pressureSlots argument in the corresponding Grid_getFluxData
!!                  call should generally match the one in the Grid_putFluxData call.
