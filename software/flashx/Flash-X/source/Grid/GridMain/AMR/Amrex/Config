# The following overrides the default value of flux_correct_perLevel for AMReX.
D flux_correct_perLevel Flux correction involves a global communication phase,
D & in which all MPI ranks participate.  This flag determines whether an
D & instance of this phase, as seen by client code like Hydro, involves blocks
D & of all refinement levels (if FALSE), or (if TRUE) is invoked per level --
D & actually, per pair of levels.  For the Amrex Grid implementation, only
D & flux_correct_perLevel==TRUE is currently implemented.
D & Client code like Hydro will typically have to organize its data flow, and
D & thus the structure of its outer loops (in particular, whether there is an
D & explicit outer loop over levels surrounding loops ober blocks),
D & differently, depending on this flag.
D & Note that this flag on its own does not turn flux correction on. It should
D & only have an effect if flux_correct is also turned on and supported.

D gr_amrex_verbosity How much output is written out. Higher number is more verbose.
PARAMETER gr_amrex_verbosity INTEGER 1 [ 0 ... ]

D gr_sanitizeDataMode What to do when some subroutines are called
D & to check for acceptable values in the dens, ener, and eint cell-centered variables
D & after a Grid operation may have resulted in grid interpolation.
D & 0: Do nothing.
D & 2: Check and report.
D & 3: Check and fix (apply floor value).
D & 4: Check and abort if cell is found below floor value.
D & (A variable mask that may be in effect for guard cell filling is currently ignored.)

D enableMaskedGCFill When enableMaskedGCFill is FALSE, Grid_fillGuardCells is forced
D &                  to always ignore optional mask arguments when present in calls.
D &                  This is the default behavior.
D &                  Set enableMaskedGCFill TRUE to enable masked guard cell filling.

ENDIF

D gr_gcFillSingleVarRange If this flag is enabled, guard cell filling will always make 
D &                       (at most) one call (per griddatastruct) to the underlying
D &                       implementation routines of the Grid implementation, requesting
D &                       communication and guard cell filling (including boundary condition handling)
D &                       for ONE contiguous range of variables. This range may include
D &                       variables that are, es expressed by a GCFill mask, not actually
D &                       needed by the caller. If the flag is FALSE, invocation of the 
D &                       underlying implementation routines can be done as several calls, 
D &                       each of which acts on a contiguous range of variables. Only takes 
D &                       effect if enableMaskedGCFill is TRUE.
