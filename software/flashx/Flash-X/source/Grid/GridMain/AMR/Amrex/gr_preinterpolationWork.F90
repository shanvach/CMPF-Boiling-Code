!! DESCRIPTION
!!  This is a callback routine that is passed to the AMReX fill patch
!!  routines, which may carry out interpolation as part of their data 
!!  movement actions.
!!
!!  AMReX calls this routine just before carrying out interpolation so that
!!  the calling application may perform any necessary work on the data
!!  that is used to perform the interpolation.  This allows for altering
!!  the data only when necessary, rather than altering *all* data before
!!  calling a routine that *might* perform interpolation.
!!
!!  This routine performs primitive-to-conservative form conversions.  Refer to
!!  the documentation for gr_primitiveToConserve for more information.  The
!!  gr_postinterpolationWork routine works in conjunction with this routine to
!!  revert data back to primitive form.  To accomplish this, it is
!!  required that the density data be non-zero.  Therefore, this routine
!!  requires that all physics units that initiate interpolation must first
!!  ensure that all density data is non-zero.
!!
!!  For the GC fill, this routine allows for transforming primitive form data
!!  to conservative form on the interior cells of a coarse block at a 
!!  fine/coarse boundary.
!!
!!  When creating a new leaf block, this routine allows for transforming 
!!  primitive form data to conservative form on the interior and guardcells
!!  of the parent block. 
!!
!!  This routine should never be called directly within FLASH.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!  lo - the index of the lower-left corner of the region of the given
!!       box that requires conversion from primitive-to-conservative.
!!  hi - the index of the upper-right corner of the region of the given
!!       box that requires cleaning and conversion from
!!       conservative-to-primitive.
!!  dlo - the lower-left index of the given box
!!  dhi - the upper-right index of the given box
!!  nd -  the number of physical quantities in box
!!  scomp - the index of the first physical quantity in the box
!!  ncomp - the number of physical quantities in the box
!!  d - the data array for the box that requires interpolation
!!
