!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Grid_getFluxData_block(type(Grid_tile_t)(in) :: blockDesc,
!!                              real(OUT),TARGET      :: fluxBufX(:,lo(1): ,lo(2): ,lo(3): ),

!!                              integer(in)           :: lo(3),
!!                              integer(in)           :: axis,

!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   Get (corrected) flux data from semipermanent flux storage (SPFS).
!!
!!    fluxBuf := "communicated fine fluxes"   AT           coarse side of f/c bdry;
!!            := "saved coarse fluxes"        ELSEWHERE AT cells touching block bdry;
!!            undef                           ELSEWHERE.
!!
!!   A stub that does nothing is used for the Uniform Grid implementation.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   blockDesc : describes the current block.
!!               Note that this should be a full block, not a tile representing
!!               a partial block.
!!
!!   fluxBufX :  buffer for fluxes in IAXIS-direction
!!
!!   fluxBufY :  buffer for fluxes in JAXIS-direction; output undefined if NDIM < 2
!!
!!   fluxBufZ :  buffer for fluxes in KAXIS-direction; output undefined if NDIM < 3
!!
!!   lo :        lower bounds for the spatial indices of the flux buffers
!!
!!  axis : integer value specifying on which cell faces to get fluxes. 
!!         The options are IAXIS, JAXIS, KAXIS, or ALLDIR defined in constants.h
!!
!!   isFluxDensity : indicates, for each flux component, whether the component
!!                   is a flux proper (if TRUE) or a flux density (otherwise).
!!                   This may be either removed, or changed into a scalar flag,
!!                   later.
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!   The arrays fluxBufX, fluxBufY, fluxBufZ are subject to index reordering.
!!
!!   flux buffer arrays should contain space for fluxes of all valid cells
!!   in the block, excluding guard cells.
!!
!!   This interface does not require level-wide fluxes to be allocated.
!!
!!   SPFS means semi-permanent flux storage. When using a Grid
!!   implementation based on AMReX, SPFS is implemented by an AMReX
!!   flux register class, such as FlashFluxRegister.
!!
!!   DEV: This interface is currently only implemented for Paramesh4 !
