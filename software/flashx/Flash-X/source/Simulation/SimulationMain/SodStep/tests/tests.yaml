# YAML file for test information
# comments start with "#"
##  SodStep
#   Sod shock tube with sections of domain taken out to create internal boundaries

#### Keywords   Hydro, boundaries within domain

#### Motivation
# This is meant to test generation of complicated boundaries by taking out
#  pieces of domain

#### Success vs. Failure
# This is a composite test therefore has two baseline files. The first file
# flashx_hdf5_chk_0001 is used as comparison test to ensure correct running, the
# second file flashx_hdf5_chk_0002 is used to ensure that restart is transparent
