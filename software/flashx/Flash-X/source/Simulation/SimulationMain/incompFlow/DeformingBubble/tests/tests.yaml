# Transparent restart for the following composite tests will fail due to 
# change in AMR configurations between intial and restart parfiles. To ensure
# correctness of the test, visually inspect the unittest files generated and
# check if they show success. Alternatively, one can use paraview to look at 
# the divergence of velocity and assert that it is zero. For latter, you 
# may want to take a look at Lab-Notebooks/AMReX-Divfree on GitHub
