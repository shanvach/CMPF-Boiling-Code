## Cellular Composite Tests 
#  This is cellular detonation setup which exercises hydro combined with nuclear burning. Typically done with Approx13 or Approx19 networks. It has a dependency on MA28 library

#### Keywords

#### Motivation
# Units exercised are Burn, Hydro, Grid, Helmholtz EOS


#### Success vs. Failure
# This is a composite test therefore has two baseline files. The first file
# flashx_hdf5_chk_0001 is used as comparison test to ensure correct running, the
# second file flashx_hdf5_chk_0002 is used to ensure that restart is transparent
