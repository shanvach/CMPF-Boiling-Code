!! NAME
!!  Driver_initAll
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!   call Driver_initAll()
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Performs Flash initializations, which includes:
!!
!!  Call all 'init' routines in units.  Order does matter,
!!  particularly when restarting from a checkpoint file.
!!
!!  For the most part, Driver_initAll calls other units' init
!!  routines directly, like call IO_init or call Grid_init.  This
!!  routine also makes calls to other Driver initialization routines
!!  like Driver_initMaterialProperties or Driver_initSourceTerms.
!!  These routines then call the unit-specific initialization 
!!  routines.  This level of abstraction was added to simplify
!!  the initialization calls.
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!! The Driver unit uses a few unit scope variables that are
!! accessible to all routines within the unit, but not to the
!! routines outside the unit. These variables begin with "dr_"
!! like, dr_globalMe or dr_dt, dr_beginStep, and are stored in fortran
!! module Driver_data (in file Driver_data.F90. The other variables
!! are local to the specific routine and do not have the prefix "dr_"
!!
!! HISTORY 
!!
!!  2008-03-14 KW   Moved material properties initialization up.
