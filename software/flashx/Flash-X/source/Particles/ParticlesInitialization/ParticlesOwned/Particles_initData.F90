!! NAME
!!
!!  Particles_initData
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Particles_initData(logical(IN)    :: restart,
!!                          logical(INOUT) :: partPosInitialized)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Initializations that depend upon the values of mesh variables
!!  such as updating attributes, calculating long/short range forces,
!!  etc.
!!
!!  When this interface is called during Flash initialization,
!!  and the current run is not a restart from a checkpoint,
!!
!!   o  particles positions (and thus particle tags) MAY have been
!!      initialized (see Grid_initDomain), and
!!   o  mass properties for active particles MAY have been initialized.
!!
!!  If particles positions are already initialized, i.e., all particles
!!  that should initially exist have already been created and dropped into
!!  their positions, the dummy argument partPosInitialized will be TRUE on
!!  entry.
!!
!!  If restart is TRUE, the default implementation does not do anything
!!  (other than call Simulation_initParticleAttrib as described below).
!!
!!  Otherwise:
!!   o  If particle positions are not yet initialized, it is done here (by
!!      calling Particles_initPositions).  Particles_initPositions will
!!      also take care of initializing particle tags uniquely.
!!   o  For particles with certain passive ADVANCE methods - currently,
!!       *  EULER_TRA
!!       *  RUNGEKUTTA
!!       *  MIDPOINT
!!       *  ESTI -
!!      this is where velocity components are initialized,
!!      unless the flag pt_velInitialized (in Particles_data)
!!      indicates that velocity initialization is considered already
!!      complete.
!!      For passive particles, this is done by mapping from
!!      the fluid velocity field. The sequence of initialization
!!      is such that fluid fields are guaranteed to have been
!!      initialized to their final starting values, and the
!!      configuration of the grid has been finalized including
!!      creation of blocks up to the maximum refinement level,
!!      when the Particles_initData interface is called.
!!
!!  The default implementation in the ParticlesInitialization
!!  subunit calls Simulation_initParticleAttrib before returning,
!!  so if custom initialization of additional particle properties
!!  is needed, that's the place to implement it.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  restart - true if restarting from a checkpoint, false otherwise.
!!  partPosInitialized - an impementation of this interface should skip
!!                       initialization of particle positions if this
!!                       dummy argument is TRUE on entry.
!!                       The value returned should always be TRUE.
!!
!! SIDE EFFECTS
!!
!!  Updates particles data that is private to the Particles unit.
!!  Updates pt_numLocal, and probably other Particles_data variables.
!!
!!  Normally sets an internal flag (pt_velInitialized) that keeps track of
!!  whether initialization of particle velocities is complete.
!!
!!  May set internal flag pt_posInitialized (indirectly, by calling Particles_initPositions).
!!
!!  Updates the pt_typeInfo data structure (by calling pt_updateTypeDS).
