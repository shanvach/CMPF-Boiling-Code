!! NAME
!!  Burn_data
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  use Burn_data
!!
!! DESCRIPTION 
!!  Burn_data is a fortran module that holds variables with
!!  the Burn Unit scope.  All variables located in Burn_data are
!!  accessible to subroutines in the Burn unit only.  (Note this 
!!  is a convention, there is nothing in the fortran language that
!!  prevents another routine from using Burn_data.  It is the FLASH3
!!  architecture that tries to enforce these rules.)
!!  
!!  All variables located in the Burn_data fortran module start with 
!! "bn_".  This is to indicate where they come from, and to make it easier
!! on the developer and user to see which variables are local variables and 
!! which belong to the Burn unit.
!!
!!
!! NOTES
!!  For those familiar with FLASH2:  The fortran data modules in FLASH3 
!!  (like this Burn_data) take the place of the database in FLASH2.
!!  In FLASH2 all the data was centrally located in the database.  In 
!!  FLASH3 each unit stores its own data.  When another unit needs to 
!!  get data from a different unit, accessor functions are used.  For example
!!  simulation time is stored in the Driver owned variable dr_simTime.  The
!!  IO unit queries the Driver unit with the accessor function
!!  Driver_getSimTime() to get the simTime and to check to see if a checkpoint
!!  needs to be written.
!! 
!! This file Burn_data was originally primarily network_common.fh in Flash2
!! Some common blocks have been moved out to other files
!!
