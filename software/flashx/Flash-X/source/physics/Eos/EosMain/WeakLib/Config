DATAFILES tables

D gamc_variable	 Ratio of specific heats.  Used to compute sound speed.
VARIABLE gamc  EOSMAP:   GAMC  # sound-speed gamma
D game_variable	 Energy gamma.  Used to convert between pressure and energy.
VARIABLE game  EOSMAP:   GAME  # energy gamma
D entr_variable	 Specific entropy in kB per baryon.
VARIABLE entr  EOSMAP:  ENTR  # specific entropy in kB per baryon

D eos_file  Filename of the table.  Data may be found at weaklib.
PARAMETER eos_file  STRING "tables/wl-EOS-SFHo-15-25-50-noBCK.h5"

#D postBounce  Flag to specify that simulation is post-bounce
#PARAMETER postBounce	   BOOLEAN	FALSE
#D bounceTime  Time of bounce in seconds
#PARAMETER bounceTime	   REAL		0.0

D eos_wl_muShift   Flag to shift neutron and chemical potentials by subtracting 
D               &  neutron-proton-mass difference to make definitions consistent
D               &  with Chimera
PARAMETER eos_wl_muShift   BOOLEAN      FALSE


# Since we cannot use EXCLUSIVE to limit only one EOS implementation
# since Hybrid needs multiple ones, the following PPDEFINE will
# be used in the non-hybrid Eos.F90 to perform a compile time check
# that only this implementation has been loaded if the Hybrid EOS has not
