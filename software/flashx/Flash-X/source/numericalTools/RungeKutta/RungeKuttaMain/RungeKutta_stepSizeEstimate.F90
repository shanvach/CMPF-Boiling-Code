!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  This function provides the user with an initial estimate in step size, based on the
!!  error vector supplied and the ODE function 'f' to be solved. The estimate is based on
!!  all local information at 'x' and is obtained as follows. Consider the finite Taylor
!!  expansion of y (x+h) around 'x':
!!
!!           y(x+h) = y(x) + hy'(x) + (h^2/2)y''(x) + ... + (h^p/p!)y^p(x) + O[h^(p+1)]
!!
!!  The truncation error O[h^(p+1)] can be expressed exactly as:
!!
!!           O[h^(p+1)] = h^(p+1)/(p+1)! * y^(p+1)(x*)   x* between x and x+h
!!
!!  where the neglected higher order terms of the Taylor expansion have been accounted for
!!  by the definition of x*. Taking only the leading error term E(p+!) in O[h^(p+1)] is
!!  equivalent of setting x*=x in the above equation:
!!
!!              E(p+1) = h^(p+1)/(p+1)! * y^(p+1)(x)
!!
!!  A Runge Kutta step of order p is like a Taylor expansion of order p and leads also to
!!  an error term O[h^(p+1)]. Hence to estimate the step size of a Runge Kutta of order p
!!  one could simply use the expression for E(p+1) and equate it with the error goal of the
!!  Runge Kutta step:
!!
!!               Runge Kutta error goal <= eFrac * eBase
!!
!!  and solve for h in the equation:
!!
!!                      eFrac * eBase >= E(p+1)
!!                      eFrac * eBase >= h^(p+1)/(p+1)! * y^(p+1)(x)
!!
!!  Since eBase and y^(p+1)(x) are vectors, the equation is actually a set of equations,
!!  one for each of the corresponding vector elements. This results in a set of different
!!  h values, of which we will take the smallest:
!!
!!                      h <= [eFrac * (p+1)! * min |eBase/y^(p+1)(x)|]^(1/(p+1))
!!  or
!!                      h <= [eFrac * (p+1)! / max |y^(p+1)(x)/eBase|]^(1/(p+1))
!!
!!  One of the difficulties with the above equation is that for high orders it becomes difficult
!!  to estimate the higher order derivative vector y^(p+1)(x). To circumvent this problem and
!!  to use lower order derivatives, it is posulated that the eBase-rescaled higher order Taylor
!!  expansion errors decay in form of a power law:
!!
!!                  E(p+1)/eBase = [E(m)/eBase]^((p+1)/m)       p+1 >= m
!!
!!  The eBase vector contains (or should contain) implicitly information about the size of
!!  the ODE's dependent variables and should never contain zero values. eFrac relates to
!!  the relative accuracy wanted for each dependent variable along the solution path of the
!!  ODE. Hence eFrac should always be < 1. The step size estimate for a Runge Kutta of order
!!  p >= m starts from the equation:
!!
!!                      eFrac * eBase >= E(p+1)
!!
!!  and uses the above postulate for E(p+1) to get:
!!
!!                h <= eFrac^(1/(p+1)) * [m! / max |y^(m)(x)/eBase|]^(1/m)
!!
!!  For calculating our step size estimate for a given Runge Kutta order p, we use the m = 1
!!  and m = 2 error estimate formulas. The following steps are taken:
!!
!!                1) Is max |y''(x)| > 0? If yes, use:
!!
!!                       h = eFrac^(1/(p+1)) * sqrt (2) / sqrt (max |y''(x)/eBase|)
!!                       h = min (h, hmax)
!!
!!                   for orders p >= 1. If no, go to step 2).
!!
!!                2) Is max |y'(x)| > 0? If yes, use:
!!
!!                       h = eFrac^(1/(p+1)) / max |y'(x)/eBase|
!!                       h = min (h, hmax)
!!
!!                   for orders p >= 1. If no, goto step 3).
!!
!!                3) Use:
!!
!!                       h = hmax
!!
!!                   for all orders.
