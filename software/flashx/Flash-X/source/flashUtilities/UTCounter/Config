USESETUPVARS mpi3

#The distributed counter makes use of MPI-3 and is the default
#implementation when FLASH is setup with +mpi3 or +libnbc.  The
#master-slave counter should work with all MPI implementations since
#it makes use of MPI-1 only.  It has optional MPI-3 features which
#will be conditionally compiled when using a setup line as follows
# > ... +mpi3 -unit=flashUtilities/UTCounter/MasterSlave
# > ... +libnbc -unit=flashUtilities/UTCounter/MasterSlave
