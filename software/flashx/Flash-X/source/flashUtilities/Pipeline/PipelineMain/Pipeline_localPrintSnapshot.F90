!! NAME
!!  
!!  Pipeline_localPrintSnapshot
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!! 
!!  call Pipeline_localPrintSnapshot (subroutine, intent (in) :: printItemDetails)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  The routine will print a snapshot of the current local state of the pipeline.
!!  It prints all items in each of the buffer, sending and receiving channels in
!!  the pipeline on the local processor.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  printItemDetails : the routine specifying the print statements for the items
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  The routine 'printItemDetails' must be defined outside the pipeline unit.
!!  It will contain the specifics of the items for which the pipeline was used.
