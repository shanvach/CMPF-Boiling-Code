# Use the Milhoja library -- FOR NOW - using some infrastructure from AMReX
# (but not necessarily a full "AMReX grid backend")
TYPE EXTERNAL

# The following is commented out. Configurations that need the part of the
# Milhoja library that implements a Grid implementation for Flash-X should
# simply request
#   LIBRARY milhoja_amrex
# instead of
#   LIBRARY milhoja
#
###LIBRARY amrex

# ... This would be a good idea, but it currently does not work even when
# it should, since the Milhoja library still depends on the AMReX
# library even in situations whne it should not - i.e., when the Grid
# implementation of Milhoja is not needed at all as far as Flash-X is
# concerned. This may come down to a few depndencies that are not
# essential and could be easily removed, like dependence on
# AMReX_IntVect.H, AMReX_RealVect.H, maybe AMReX_Box.H in the non-Grid
# part of Milhoja.
# So anyway, for now reinstated:

LIBRARY amrex
