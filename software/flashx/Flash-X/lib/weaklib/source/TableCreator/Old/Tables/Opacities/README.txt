The provenance of these Equations of State are as follows:
( Origin/Type of Table ) - ( Table Identifier ) - ( Resolution of Table in rho-T-Ye ) 

Origin/Type:
example: wl-OP: This is a Weaklib generated OP (Opacity) Table.

Table Identifier: 
example: LS220

Resolution of Table:
example: 20-20-50 is 20 pts/decade in rho and T, and 50 pts/1.00 in Ye

Example: If a table is named as wl-OP-LS220-20-20-50.h5,
         its corresponding EOS Table is wl-EOS-LS220-20-20-50.h5
