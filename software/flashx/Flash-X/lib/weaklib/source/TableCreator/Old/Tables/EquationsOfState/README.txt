The provenance of these Equations of State are as follows:
( Origin/Type of Table ) - ( Table Identifier ) - ( Resolution of Table in rho-T-Ye ) 

Origin/Type:
example: wl-EOS: This is a Weaklib generated EOS Table.

Table Identifier: 
example: LS220

Resolution of Table:
example: 20-20-50 is 20 pts/decade in rho and T, and 50 pts/1.00 in Ye
