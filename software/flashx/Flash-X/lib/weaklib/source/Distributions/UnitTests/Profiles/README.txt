The provenance of these supernova explosion profiles is as follows:
( Origin/Type of Profile ) - ( EOS Identifier ) - ( Resolution of Table in rho-T-Ye, if from EOS table ) 
  -( Epoch )
Origin/Type:
example: wl-EOS: This is a Weaklib generated EOS Profile.

EOS Identifier: 
example: LS220

Resolution of Table:
example: 20-20-50 is 20 pts/decade in rho and T, and 50 pts/1.00 in Ye, or DirectCall

Epoch: 
example: 0ms post-bounce, 100 ms post-bounce, etc.
