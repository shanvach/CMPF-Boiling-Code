# Use the Milhoja library with the AMReX grid backend
#
# Originally there was only a milhoja external library.  However the setup tool
# added LIB_AMREX before LIB_MILHOJA in the link command.  Since Milhoja depends
# on AMReX, linking failed.  I manually add ${LIB_AMREX} to the end of
# LIB_MILHOJA in my Makefile for linking to be successful (i.e., LIB_AMREX
# occurs twice in the link command).
#
# Since Milhoja could eventually have many grid backends and we might want to
# use all of these on a single platform, this hack would not work.  Therefore,
# a temporary workaround is to have a milhoja_* library for each grid backend.
#
# TODO: Update the setup tool so that link order relationships can be expressed
# in Config files.
